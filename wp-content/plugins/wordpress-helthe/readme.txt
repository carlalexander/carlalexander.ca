Become a bug fixing hero! Get all the information you need to solve those pesky bugs once and for all using WordPress Error Monitoring by Helthe.

== Description ==

Wondering what's really going on with your WordPress installation? WordPress has a very unique way of dealing with [errors](http://www.carlalexander.ca/programming/diving-into-wordpress-errors/). Because of that, WordPress will often not let you know if there is a problem and that can mean hours of painful troubleshooting for you.

WordPress Error Monitoring plugin was built the ground up by [Helthe](https://helthe.co) to extract relevant errors from WordPress and log them for you in your PHP error log.

This plugin was specifically designed to be used in a production environment.

== Installation ==

1. Install either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the `wordpress-helthe` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Configure the plugin by going to the `Helthe Monitoring` menu that appears in your `Settings` admin menu.
4. Go save the cheerleader!
