Fed up with the lack of automated tools to properly crop and scale post thumbnails? Maybe this plugin can help.

== Description ==

To meet the needs of themes where the post-thumbnails have random and capricious sizes (which causes wordpress to crop images simply from the middle (either chopping off the top and bottom or chopping off the sides), this plugin attempts to give the users an interface to manually fix those thumbnail and random images.

== Installation ==

1. Download the zip file from <http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/post-thumbnail-editor.zip>
2. Unzip to your wp-content/plugins directory under the wordpress installation.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Rock On

= or =

1. Install from within your wordpress admin area by searching for "post thumbnail editor"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

	2. Click the "Thumbnail" link in the rollover options.
2. or start within image editor interface (when viewing image details)
	1. Click "Edit Image"

3. Using Post Thumbnail Editor Interface
	1. Select the thumbnails you want to edit. If a thumbnail defines a specific aspect ratio it will be applied to the editor.  If you select thumbnails with more than 1 different aspect ratios, this feature is disabled.  Be careful or you might make some of your pictures look funny.

	3. Click "Create Thumbnails" -- this button is only enabled if you have thumbnails selected and a crop area defined.
	4. Thumbnail Preview: select all the thumbnails you want to keep and click "Okay, these look good".
4. It's possible that you might have to refresh the cache (ctrl+f5 on the page) to see changes, but they should be there.

= Did you even test this? =

Yes. No. Sort of. Thanks for asking. But [let me know if you're having problems](https://github.com/sewpafly/post-thumbnail-editor/issues) and I'll see what I can do.

= Is there a way to regenerate images created by this plugin? =

Do you really want this?  I haven't gotten any feedback that this is desirable... So imma let it go for now.

= What version of PHP do I need? =

Using a version with [json_encode](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php) enabled would be nice...
